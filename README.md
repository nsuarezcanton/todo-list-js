## todo-list-js
“To-Do List” is a simple JavaScript app that allows users to maintain a list of tasks. The user should also be able to edit, delete or mark tasks as complete. The development of this app will take place in two phases, Phase I & Phase II. Phase III is optional.
### Requirements
* When the user enters a task in the "To-do" text-box and clicks the ADD button, it will get added to the list. **[X]**
* If they type a task and hit the enter key, it will also get added to the list. **[X]**
* If the user checks the check-box next to a task, the system will cross-out the task to mark it as completed. **[X]**
* If the user un-checks the check-box next to a task, the system will remove the cross-out to mark the task as incomplete. **[X]**
* If the user clicks the delete link next to a task, that task will be removed from the list. **[X]**
* If the user clicks the edit link next to a task, the task will become editable. **[X]**
